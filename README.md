 photo gallery


Welcom to my Photogallery website. This website is an alternative of some website where you can upload photos into the website.
and you can see all the uploaded photos in gallery which is a page within the website and also I added a page called collection where 
you can create a collection with photos that you uploaded so you can sort of differenciate, categories for example.

I used Jquery for the framwwork, Html,some css, and javascript!  I used Node.js as well!
iam not doing anything with  image files instead i am trying to do URLs only so that it is going to be easier to move on to saving data on the server.
I want to allow people to enter the web addresses of existing pictures for now. so that my code can just store and manipukate simple URLs string instead of an entire file.

the goal of this website is to allowed users to upload photos and then after creates some cool collections! for now it is a school project and it is open to everyone with the website link to upload photos.

i am planning to make possible for users to log in and have their profiles so that everytime you upload you can create a link to send to someone who can only have access to that specific collection and gallery.
